In this project, I will create the game Rock Paper Scissors to be playable in the console using JavaScript.

This project solidifies problem solving skills, pseudocode and algorithmic thinking.

We will create a logic t oreceive a human choice for rock, paper or scissors, and a computer choice. We will then determine who wins the round, keep track of a score, and completing a logic for a full game.
